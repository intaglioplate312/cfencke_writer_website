          <p class="left-align light">

CHICAGO – Milhouse Engineering &amp; Construction (Milhouse) is proud to have been named Illinois 8(a) Graduate of the Year by the Small Business Association (SBA). Milhouse was also awarded as 8(a) Graduate of the Year by the Great Lakes Region, which covers Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and Ohio.
<br><br>
SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program helps small, disadvantaged businesses compete in the marketplace and access government contracts.

The program helps thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs gain a foothold in government contracting.

Forward-looking Statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements covered by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Because such statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results for fiscal year 2014 and beyond could differ materially from the Company's current expectations. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "anticipates," "projects," "expects," "plans," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "targets," and other similar expressions that indicate trends and future events.  
 <br><br>
Factors that could cause the Company's results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements include, without limitation, variation in demand and acceptance of the Company's products and services, the frequency, magnitude and timing of paper and other raw-material-price changes, general business and economic conditions beyond the Company's control, timing of the completion and integration of acquisitions, the consequences of competitive factors in the marketplace including the ability to attract and retain customers, results of continuous improvement and other cost-containment strategies, and the Company's success in attracting and retaining key personnel. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, since these statements may no longer be accurate or timely.</p>
