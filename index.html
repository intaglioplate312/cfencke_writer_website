      <div class="collapsible-header">Milhouse Generation: Power in Nigeria</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p class="left-align light">

Milhouse Generation Services Ltd. (Generation) is on a fast track to produce power in Nigeria deploying a clean coal technology. Generation was recently granted a 30 MW license from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to produce power in Enugu, a state in Nigeria where significant coal deposits exist.
<br>
<br>Generation is incorporated in Nigeria and owned by Milhouse International, LLC.  President/ CEO Wilbur C. Milhouse III, PE, leads Milhouse Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. and his international enterprises.  Mr. Milhouse is excited about the potential that Nigeria has, given its abundant natural resources.
<br>
<br>While studying energy sources in Nigeria, Mr. Milhouse discovered there are currently no coal-to-power projects underway there, despite the country’s massive coal reserves.  Generation will be the first coal-to-power individual power producer in the southeast region.  “Clean coal technologies are the best bet for the region,” said Frank Martin, Vice President of Power Development for Generation.  Power systems require abundant fuel sources close to the location where power is generated, which is why available local coal is a boon.
<br>
<br>Mr. Milhouse believes the area’s coal reserves can support up to 1,000 MW of electricity.  Generation is planning to realize the project’s full potential in phases.  The U.S. and other developed economies traditionally have grown because of significant coal reserves that were situated close to the surface.  Even today, the U.S. generates most of its power from coal, with natural gas a close second.  Although solar and wind have seen some implementation, they only comprise about 5% of the U.S. energy mix.
<br>
<br>Mr. Milhouse is on a mission to give Nigeria the same chance as developed nations.
Nigeria had generated electricity from coal in the 1950s, but this was abandoned in the wake of the Biafra war (1967-1970) when the focus changed to petroleum. Nigeria now generates electricity mostly from gas thermal plants (roughly 80%) and hydropower (roughly 20%).
<br>
<br>Nigeria has about 8,000 MW available electricity generation capacity but only 3,000-4,000 MW is operational. Government now wishes to aggressively grow its generation capacity and diversify the electricity generation mix by encouraging private sector participation.  The administration has expressed significant interest in generating electricity from coal.
<br>
<br>Milhouse plans to build capacity as the grid strengthens over time.  “The instability of the national grid is still a key issue,” said Joseph Zurad, PE, Executive Vice President. Mr. Zurad is Milhouse’s most senior electrical engineer with over 40 years of experience.  He points out that smaller projects that can be expanded quickly are the best option for Nigeria.
<br>
<br>The diesel generator is the most common form of power production in Nigeria.  Estimates show that the direct cost of self-generated electricity in Nigeria is up to four times the cost of public- supplied electricity from the national grid. In addition, the environmental risk is substantial.  Emissions and noise from the generator are a significant hazard.
<br>
<br>Today, clean coal technologies are highly efficient, dependable, long lasting, and have all but eliminated harmful emissions.  Developed economies have been implementing clean coal solutions for over 20 years. The typical solution eliminates over 95% of the sulfur content that in the past, had negatively impacted the environment.
<br>
<br>Such technologies meet global emissions standards.  While they can be more expensive operationally than gas-fired, solar, and wind technologies, they are much more efficient and reliable than those sources.
<br>
<br>The Generation project aims to offer significant job opportunities for the community.  The plant alone will employ over 100 local residents ranging from plant operations, security, maintenance and administrative personnel.
<br>
<br>Milhouse is interested in supporting the current administration’s economic recovery and transformation initiative of expanding power sector infrastructure.  The administration’s goal is to produce 10 GW of power by 2020.  This will require a proper energy mix, to which Milhouse is excited to contribute.  As power supply and generation mix expands, it will create jobs and empower Nigeria’s bustling youth population.</p></span></div>

      <div class="collapsible-header">Luciana Souza at Mandel Hall</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p class="left-align light"><span><em>Published in the Hyde Park Herald</em></span>
<br>
On the last Friday night of April, a rainstorm and shocks of lightning jumped at the windows of University of Chicago’s Mandel Hall. Inside the humid room, the sultry bossa nova and jazz stylings of Grammy-winning vocal artist Luciana Souza filled the air. It was so warm inside that Souza herself quipped that it felt more like Brazil than Chicago.
<br>
<br>Composer, teacher and jazz innovator Souza performed songs from her latest recording, “The New Bossa Nova,” a title which is not a new movement in the Brazilian genre, she said. However, it does describe her album -- a new turn on some American pop favorites. It includes a cover of the bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, but the focus is on slow, expressive versions of Americans such as James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and The Beach Boys.
<br>
<br>Souza took the stage with her band in one of her final performances before a year-long maternity leave. Dressed for comfort in low sandals and a long, black sundress, which couldn’t hide her ample baby bump, she asked, “Can you tell?”
<br>
<br>Opening and closing her hour-and-a-half set with electrifying versions of Brazilians, she began with Joao Gilberto’s “Adeus America,” which she described to the Portuguese-challenged among the audience as about a Brazilian who, when he travels to America longs to be back in his home.
<br>
<br>Ever the innovator, Souza covered the haunting “Down to You,” from Joni Mitchell’s album “Court and Spark.” She also offered an ethereal retelling of the lively “God Only Knows,” from The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds.”
<br>
<br>The artist concluded with Jobim’s “Aguas de Marco,” or “Waters of March,” which signals a quiet, rhythmic natural rebirth or renewal. Souza gave a detailed back story of the song. The month of March brings the end of the Brazilian winter and delivers torrential rains. The lyrics are a soft chant giving a long list of items that are left in the rains’ wake: “…A stick, a stone, It's the end of the road, It's the rest of a stump, It's a little alone… .” It is evidence of the people of Brazil: rich, middle class as well as the many of Brazil’s poor, all who are at risk of getting washed out by the rains.

      <div class="collapsible-header">Chicago Park District and Outlook</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p class="left-align light">
            <span><em>published in Hyde Park Herald and Lakefront Outlook</em></span>
            <br>
During 2008, one Bronzeville park celebrated a new addition and another saw trouble even before it opened.
<br><br>
In October, Mayor Daley and Chicago Park District management celebrated Washington Park’s new signature children’s playlot. It opened later than expected—in October rather than the July date the Washington Park Advisory Council had anticipated. Chicago weather, including rain and humidity, was a contributing factor, said Michael Kelly, CPD chief operating officer. 
<br><br>
The playlot, located just south of the swimming pool, cost $700,000 to build, with mostly private funding. Much of the money came from proceeds from Lollapalooza, the weekend music festival that takes place in Grant Park in August, which The Parkways Foundation organizes every year.
<br><br>
Washington Park Advisory Council president, Cecilia Butler, was very proud of the results of months of working with the Chicago Park District. “What this park shows is how government can really work. This is the playground out of the four in Washington Park that has been here the longest. It’s at least 90 years old,” she said.
<br><br>
Many of the playlot’s features were a joint effort between the CPD and the community, with the input of children who use the park, said Beth Meier Tomlins, project manager for the Chicago Park District. Icons imprinted into the sidewalks represent play and pride in the neighborhood, including one highlighting long-time activist and artist Dr. Margaret Burroughs of the DuSable Museum of African American History, 740 E. 56th Place. And a picture of philosopher Sun Ra holding an outdoor forum incorporates ideas of the park’s 160-year history. 
<br><br>
The park’s history as a sheep farm and as the location of the original Washington Park race track is represented in whimsical toys in the shapes of sheep and horses. 
<br><br>
On another note, a yet-to-be opened green space has neighbors and community groups worried. The park under construction at the corner of Lake Park Avenue and 41st Street doesn’t even have a name yet. But people have reported problems already-established parks see all too often: trash, loitering, graffiti and drug-dealing.
<br><br>
“There is evidence of drug-dealing,” said Shirley Newsome, North Kenwood Oakland Community Council chair. “People have seen known gang members in the park.”
<br><br>
The problems stem in part from unsupervised teens, who began frequenting the park after construction fencing surrounding it was removed after the July 4 weekend, neighbors said. 
<br><br>
Developer Draper and Kramer is building the park in conjunction with the first phase of homes at Lake Park Crescent, one of the mixed-income developments replacing the former Chicago Housing Authority’s Lakefront Homes. A tot lot within the park is finished, but the rest of it won’t likely be done until this coming spring, according to Ald. Toni Preckwinkle (4th).
<br><br>
Community organizer, Newsome, is especially concerned because oversight has slipped, she has said. Police are monitoring the park, and neighbors, such as local resident, Marian Jones, are monitoring the problems. Meanwhile, Preckwinkle has faith in the success of the park in the New Year. “Over time, we get a handle on things, and they improve,” she said.

      <div class="collapsible-header">Edgewater Committee Working to Achieve Dramatic Ecological Goals</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p class="left-align light">
           <span><em>published in Inside Publications NewsStar</em></span>

<br><br>
The calendar says that the season is spring, even though the snowfall last week seemed to disagree. To be sure, with Earth Day fast approaching, this is the perfect time to start thinking about “green” initiatives, and Uncommon Ground restaurant in Rogers Park would be an excellent place to start. 
<br><br>
On Thursday, April 9, at 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., the location at 1401 W. Devon Ave. offers its free monthly green room session “eco-mixer,” a place to enjoy complimentary appetizers and listen to experts dish out gardening and ecological advice. This time it will host speakers from the Edgewater Community Council who will present the Edgewater Environmental Plan, a detailed approach for neighbors to connect with one another to work toward environmental change. As members of the committee, Uncommon Ground owners Helen and Michael Cameron will also talk about the cutting-edge eatery’s many growing goals.
<br><br>
The Council, which marks its 50th anniversary in 2010, is looking to make Edgewater “the model green and sustainable community in the city,” said Anne Comeau, co-chair of the Edgewater Beautiful Committee, part of the ECC which encourages practical community beautification efforts through environmentally sound practices.   
<br><br>
“We’re looking to make it a LEED N.D. certified neighborhood,” said Comeau. LEED N.D. is a rating for neighborhood design which will be launched this summer, according to the U.S. Green Building Council Web site. “LEED for Neighborhood Development emphasizes the creation of compact, walkable, vibrant, mixed-use neighborhoods with good connections to nearby communities.”
<br><br>
A committee of experts is shopping a plan for the more than 60,000-person area between Foster Avenue on the south, Devon Avenue on the north, Lake Michigan on the east and Ravenswood Avenue on the west that aims for change and action, reads its presentation found at www.edgewater2020.org. 
<br><br>
Among ten points of focus are alternative energy, cleaning the neighborhood and education and public awareness. It also highlights developing sustainable public schools and saving time and money by using local stores for shopping. 
<br><br>
On March 12, Emmanuel Church, 5959 N. Sheridan Road, hosted a roll-out in which about 175 residents came to find out how they could get involved, said Comeau. “We did get quite a few people interested in energy efficient homes and transportation. ‘We’d like to work on parks,’ other people said. We were very encouraged about that,” said. Comeau. 
<br><br>
Cameau said that it’s a very large and complicated project, especially for an old Chicago neighborhood. But she also thinks that once the group gets the word out about how energy efficiency can save money, more and more people will pay attention. 
<br><br>
The Camerons are the creative force behind both Uncommon Ground locations, including the first, popular spot at 3800 N. Clark St. in Wrigleyville. On Thursday people can also learn about the first certified organic rooftop farm in the country, cited by MOSA, the Midwest Organic Services Association. 
<br><br>
The owners encourage interested Chicagoans to find out how they can help in the farm and learn a few things in the process. The 4,000 sq. ft. structure provides almost 1/4 acre of room to grow crops, said Helen. 
<br><br>
A farm on the roof not only decreases pollutants for the neighborhood, but all the food produced will be used in the restaurant, she said. Among the top crops expected to grace diners’ plates soon will be tomatoes, especially exotic heirloom varieties. Also look to find peas, beans, cucumbers and different greens. “The goal is as much amazingly fresh food as possible,” said Helen. 
<br><br>
In addition, during May through October on “Farmer Fridays,” Uncommon Grounds’ organic Farmer’s Market in the parking lot at Devon every Friday 4-8 p.m., offers produce from Harvest Moon Organic Farm, a local grower with whom the restaurateurs partner.  
<br><br> 
In addition, five solar-thermal panels help heat the restaurants water. Not stopping with the restaurant, the Camerons also donate the kitchen’s used fryer oil to the Loyola University Bio-Diesel program.
